# OOP Exercises in C#
This repository contains two main challenges designed to help you practice and understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#. Each challenge focuses on important OPP concept such as **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** (though not all concepts may appear in every challenge).


## Challenge 1: Employee.cs 
This challenge invloves creating an `Employee` class to represent individuals in an organisational setting. It provides a foundation for learning about classes, objects properties, and methods, as well as the basics of encapsulation and abstraction. 


## Challenge 2: BankAccount.cs 
This challenge features a `BankAccount` class that demonstrates the power of encapsulation by prevening direct access to the account's internal fields. Public methids enable depositing and withdrawing funds while maintaining strict control over the data. 


## Challenge 3: Contact.cs 
This challenge represents a person or entity with identifiable information, such as namem email address, and phone number. This class typcially works alongside other classes (for instance, `PhoneNumber`).


## Challenge 4: PhoneNumber.cs 
Stores and validates a phone number, potentially including country codes, area codes, and local numbers. A dedicated `PhoneNumber` class can improve data integrity and readability by isolating phone-related logic. 


## Challenge 5: ModArrayList.cs 
Acts as a custom collection or an enhanced version of a regular array/list in C#. This class can introduce specialised behaviours, or constraints when adding, removing, or iterating over elements.
